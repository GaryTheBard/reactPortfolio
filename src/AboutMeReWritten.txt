The Spark of Creation

Art, for me, isn't a fear of death, nor a simple desire for fame. It's the embers of immortality flickering within us all. It's leaving a whisper of our existence, a melody echoing through time.

As Gary The Bard, I've poured my voice into four self-released albums, weaving rich melodies and lyrics within the tapestry of Folk and Rock. But genres are just starting points. I dabble in Classical, Country, Jazz, and Electronic, letting the music guide me wherever it flows.

My creative wellspring extends beyond music. Words dance in poems and stories, while I sculpt forms in 3D and paint emotions onto canvases. I'm a dabbler in many mediums. The dream is to one day fully immerse myself in the arts.
